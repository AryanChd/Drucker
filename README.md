## 📖 About the Project

**Drucker** is an e-commerce website designed specifically for selling printers. This project was developed as part of our *Information Systems* module during the first year of the BSc (Hons) Computing course.

The name **“Drucker”** is derived from the German word for *printer*, which we discovered during the initial research phase of the project.

This was a group project completed by me and three classmates. Together, we planned, analyzed, and built a functional information system for an online printer store.
